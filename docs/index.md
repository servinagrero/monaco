    The documentation and the tool are still in progress. Expect things to change or to break.

## Motivation

This project started as a way to facitilate the process of performing complex electronic parametric simulations. Some of the simulations requirements are so convoluted that most of the tools are unable to perform them. This tool tries to solve this issue by providing an interface where user generated values are injected into multiple templates that can be fed to any software or script.
