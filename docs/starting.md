# Installation

Monaco can be built by having [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html) installed in the system and then running the following commands.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/servinagrero/monaco && cd monaco
$ cargo install
```

The static binary `monaco` will be generated in the directory.
