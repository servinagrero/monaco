# Introduction

This tool provides utilities to generate values that get injected into different templates. The user configures a project as a set of templates, a set of value generators and a command to be executed. The can be executed multiple times allowing the generation of mulitple files.

This project has been heavily influenced by [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) and [Github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).
